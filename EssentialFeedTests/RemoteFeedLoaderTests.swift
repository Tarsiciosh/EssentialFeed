/*
To test using a singleton:
- make "shared" in the singleton class be a variable
- move the test logic form the RemoteFeedLoader to the HTTPClient (capturing the url)
- to do that then we create a get method in the HTTPClient and capture the url there
- create a spy subclassing the singleton class with old things needed to the test and then change the singleton shared with the spy
- remove the private initializer to let the spy initialize

To start removing the singleton
- inject the client into the RemoteFeedLoader (constructor injection)
- remove the shared instance of the singleton class
- transform the abstract class HTTPClient to a protocol
- then the spy instead of inheriting the HTTPClient it implements the HTTPClient protocol
 
Test the URL is ok:
- assert if the url is the same as the one given to the RemoteFeedLoader (change to accept a URL)
